It is truly an honor to witness this rapidly evolving era, where the capabilities of LLM have experienced explosive growth in just a few years. This surge has opened up more opportunities for real-world applications, thanks to lower costs and stronger performance.

The next crucial step is enhancing the ability of Language Agent to effectively complete diverse real-world tasks, as this directly determines the "last mile" of deployment. We are also excited to see progress in both the structural design and training of Language Agentâ€”both of which contribute to improving task completion rates.

Training Language Agent is emerging as a crucial, yet still nascent, technology. In this repository, we aim to stand at the forefront of training Agent, pushing the boundaries of what is possible.
