We are witnessing an exciting era where LLM capabilities have rapidly advanced in just a few years, enabling lower costs and stronger performance for real-world applications.

The next key step is to enhance Language Agents' ability to handle diverse tasks, which is crucial for deployment. We also focus on optimizing their structure and training methods to improve task completion rates.

Training Language Agents is an essential yet still emerging technology. This repository is dedicated to pushing the boundaries and exploring new possibilities in this field.
